INTRODUCTION
------------

SuperSaaS.com is a flexible online appointment scheduling system that works with
many different businesses and is available in 24 languages. The basic version is
free, a paid version is available for large users and commercial uses.

The module displays a *Book now* button that automatically logs the user into a
SuperSaaS schedule using his Drupal user name. It passes the user's information
along, creating or updating the user's information on SuperSaaS as needed. This
saves users from having to log in twice.

  site.
  - If you see an error Email is not a valid email address then make sure that
  you have configured correctly your SuperSaaS account.
